# PrevUtilities

This package allows you to easily import the files from the Medium tutorial [How to Create Reusable SwiftUI Previews That Can Be Saved As JSON Files](https://medium.com/better-programming/how-to-create-reusable-swiftui-previews-that-can-be-saved-as-json-files-2ca7b42c9ac6). 

# Devices as Codable structs 
This package allows saving and loading devices to a JSON file.

Here's an example file that could be loaded into any project:

    {"previews":
	    [
		{"colorScheme":"dark","device":"iPhone 11 Pro","displayName":"First"},
		{"colorScheme":"light","displayName":"Second","width":700,"height":500}
	    ]
    }

# Constants for iOS 13 devices
As seen below, the package provides convenient constants for all iOS 13 supported devices, so you don't need to pass a string to the constructor for PreviewDevice anymore.

You can also pass an array of devices, eliminating the need to put your View inside a Group and repeat it several times with different devices.
```swift
       import SwiftUI
    
    struct ContentView: View {
      var body: some View {
        Text("Hello world")
      }
    }
    
    struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
      static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
          .previewDevices([.iPhone_8, .iPhone_11_Pro_Max, .iPad_7thGen, .iPad_Pro_12Point9Inch])
      }
    }
    
    
    extension View {
      public func previewDevices(_ values: [PreviewDevice]) -> some View {
        Group {
          ForEach(0..<values.count, id: \.self) {
            index in
            self.previewDevice(values[index])
          }
